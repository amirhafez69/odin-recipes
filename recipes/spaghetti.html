    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Spaghetti (Italian: [spaˈɡetti]) is a long, thin, solid, cylindrical pasta. It is a staple food of 
        traditional Italian cuisine. Like other pasta, spaghetti is made of milled wheat and water and sometimes 
        enriched with vitamins and minerals. Italian spaghetti is typically made from durum wheat semolina. 
        Usually the pasta is white because refined flour is used, but whole wheat flour may be added. Spaghettoni is 
        a thicker form of spaghetti, while capellini is a very thin spaghetti.</p>
